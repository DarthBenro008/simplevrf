# Smart Contracts

SimpleVrf's core logic is implemented as a Fuel smart contract. It manages randomness requests, authorities, fees, and proof verification.

## Main Components

- **SimpleVrf Contract**: Handles requests, proof submission, authority management, and callbacks
- **ABI**: Interface for interacting with the contract from off-chain tools
- **Example Contract**: Shows how to integrate SimpleVrf into your own Fuel contracts

## Request Flow

1. User or contract calls `request(seed)` on the SimpleVrf contract
2. The request is stored and awaits fulfillment
3. Worker submits a VRF proof via `submit_proof(seed, proof)`
4. Contract verifies the proof and triggers the callback
