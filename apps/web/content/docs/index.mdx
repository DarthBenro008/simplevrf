A decentralized, verifiable random number generation protocol for the Fuel Network.

SimpleVrf leverages Elliptic Curve Verifiable Random Function (ECVRF) and Byzantine fault-tolerant quorum consensus to provide cryptographically secure, unpredictable, and verifiable randomness for smart contracts and decentralized applications.

## Why SimpleVrf?

- **Decentralized**: No single point of failure or trust
- **Verifiable**: Anyone can verify the randomness on-chain
- **Fuel-native**: Built for the Fuel Network ecosystem
- **Modular**: Use the ECVRF library, CLI, or off-chain worker independently

## What Can You Do?

- Request random numbers in your Fuel smart contracts
- Integrate verifiable randomness into games, lotteries, or leader election
- Use the CLI for contract management and requests
- Run the worker to automate proof generation and fulfillment
