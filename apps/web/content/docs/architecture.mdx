SimpleVrf is composed of several modular components that interact to provide decentralized, verifiable randomness:

## Components

- **ECVRF Package**: TypeScript implementation of Elliptic Curve Verifiable Random Function (RFC 9381)
- **SimpleVrf Smart Contract**: Fuel contract that manages requests, authorities, and proof verification
- **Worker**: Off-chain service that monitors the contract, generates proofs, and submits them
- **CLI**: Command-line interface for interacting with the contract
- **Web App**: (Optional) Frontend for documentation and interaction

## High-Level Flow

1. A user or contract requests randomness from the SimpleVrf contract
2. The request is stored on-chain
3. The off-chain worker monitors for unfulfilled requests
4. The worker generates a VRF proof and submits it to the contract
5. The contract verifies the proof and triggers a callback with the random value

## Component Interactions

- The CLI and web app interact with the contract for management and monitoring
- The worker automates proof generation and submission
- The ECVRF package is used by the worker for cryptographic operations
